               This composition was compelling to be because the colors had seemed to be very synchronized even before adjusting the tone.
                Also, the split composition was appealing. The division between the figure and computer almost seems intentional. It almost
                reminds me of a comic book panel. I think this picture is especially narrative because of the position of the figure in relation
                to the other objects as well.

                This image is compelling because of the zoomed composition. The focus seems to be on the card because of the drastic
                difference of colors. The colors of the card compared to everything else in the background is a big contrast. The handbag
                is dull in color which leaves room for the card to take the main focus. I think this composition is also somewhat of a split one.
                The tones are interesting to me because they are dull yet very reflective to the other image I chose.
