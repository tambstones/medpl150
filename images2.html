                Photography is an essential part of everyday life. Sontag uses the word “collect” to describe the process of photography. The word perfectly highlights the significance of the intentions behind individual photographs. My major is heavily influenced by the photographs I take. Through studying studio art, I have been able to communicate all of my ideas through original photography. In some instances, I’ll choose random photographs to make “practice” paintings of. Although these originally were chosen at random, I’ve found that I have always been able to make meaning out of these practice paintings. This is mainly because every photo was taken with at least some intention. When writing artist statements, my mind always goes back to how the composition was important in the narrative aspects of my paintings. Personally, my eye is drawn to L-shape compositions, because I believe it captures packed narratives while leaving room to breath within the image. On page 5, Sontag states that “A photograph passes for incontrovertible proof that a given thing happened. The picture may distort; but there is always a presumption that something exists, or did exist, which is like what’s in the picture.” I think it connects with the whole idea of photos being part of a “collection”. It also reminds me of my personal practice of printmaking. The majority of printmaking involves manipulating images digitally just to have them become physical objects. I see each printmaking technique as different mediums. Printmaking is one of the most unpredictable methods of creating art and the results are almost always different, even when the same methods are being used. 

The idea that photography replaced paintings is so interesting. As a painting major, we are taught to observe every detail, the shapes of each shadow, and translate those details into work. There is a certain appreciation to how careful painters are able to capture the smallest details of photographs. Before photography was even a thing, paintings took the role of gathering evidence and documenting collections. Photography served as a more swift and convenient way of remembering events. Now, both practices work in unison to help mark events. I view personal paintings as moments of documentation. These carefully chosen pieces of media are important reminders of different stages in my life. What caught my eye during those stages is something I’d like to pay more attention to. To me, certain compositions leave space for viewers to digest stories while also leaving some parts open to interpretation. 

In relation to the world right now, I think photography plays such a big role in accurately capturing historical events. With the rise of AI, authentic photographs are significant in moving away from fabricated images. Also, with so many political events since the latest election, it is so important that historians accurately document every event as in past years. It becomes more challenging because of the pressures of straying away from incorrectly depicting these events. AI is also manipulating text documents, which leaves it harder to detect and eliminate inauthentic texts.
